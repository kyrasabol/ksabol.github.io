            V1 (Week of: April 18-24) <br />
            This week I created the home page for my site. This included adding my navigation, adding sections such as my introduction,
            the tips section, and the about me section. I also created a basic style sheet for my home page. The CSS render the page in the font I wanted,
            created colored boxes to seperate my sections, and made the hyperlinks to internal and external sources much more aesthetically pleasing. In the
            future, I do think I will rearrange some of the CSS organization I have going on to make it easier to search and to apply rules. This first draft
            is a little scattered. I later hope to switch the "About Me" section into a side column and add a personal photo. I also might mess around with 
            the look of the "Ready" section. The pages with "Under Construction" will see some added content over the next few weeks.
